## **Features** ✨  
- **Normal Mode**: Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷).  
- **Scientific Mode**: Calculate advanced functions:  
  - Trigonometric (sin, cos, tan, cot)  
  - Logarithms (log)  
  - Square roots (√)  
  - Exponential functions (EXP)  
  - Constants like π (PI).  
- Dynamic UI switching between Normal and Scientific modes.  
- Robust error handling for invalid inputs.

## **Technologies Used** 💻  
- **HTML**: For structuring the interface.  
- **CSS**: For styling and responsiveness.  
- **JavaScript**: For functionality and logic.

## **How It Works** ⚙️  
1. **Switch Modes**: Use the dropdown to switch between Normal and Scientific modes.  
2. **Input Calculations**: Click buttons for numbers, operators, or functions.  
3. **Evaluate**: Press `=` to see results, or use `AC` to reset and `DEL` to delete the last input.  
4. **Advanced Features**: For scientific functions, input values (e.g., `√(16)` or `sin(30)`).

## 📊 Challenges & Solutions  

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Making trigonometric and logarithmic functions work correctly | Used `Math` object in JavaScript like `Math.sin()`, `Math.log()` etc. |
| Designing buttons for both calculator types in a single UI | Used conditional rendering and class toggles to show/hide buttons |
| Making the layout responsive on all screen sizes | Used Bootstrap grid and media queries |
| Managing input validation for complex operations | Wrote utility functions to handle user input safely |
