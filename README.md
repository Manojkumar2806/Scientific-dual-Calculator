## **Features** ✨  
- **Normal Mode**: Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷).  
- **Scientific Mode**: Calculate advanced functions:  
  - Trigonometric (sin, cos, tan, cot)  
  - Logarithms (log)  
  - Square roots (√)  
  - Exponential functions (EXP)  
  - Constants like π (PI).  
- Dynamic UI switching between Normal and Scientific modes.  
- Robust error handling for invalid inputs.
